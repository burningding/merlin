## VC_VAE: re-implemented variation autoencoder based voice conversion baselines

This repository contains the variation autoencoder based voice conversion baselines. Both frame-to-frame model and seq-to-seq model are included.

Running the code
---------------------------

To train the model, run

```
python path_to_merlin/egs/vc_vae/s1/train_val.py
```

To test the model, run

```
python path_to_merlin/egs/vc_vae/s1/test.py
```

Preprocess and postprocess are the same as those in path_to_merlin/egs/voice_conversion/s1
